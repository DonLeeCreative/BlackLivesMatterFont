Black Lives Matter Font: We turn physical Black Lives Matter murals into digital fonts to preserve the #BlackLivesMatterM message.
-

On 6/5/20, a message of solidarity for #BlackLivesMatter was painted in front of the White House. Since then, many other cities across the U.S and even some abroad have followed suit. Unfortunately, as we saw in Martinez, CA over the weekend, people will go through great lengths to spew their hatred by vandalizing these city approved murals.

So, we preserved the message by turning physical murals into digital fonts: Black Lives Matter Font. This font pack will be continuously updated, it currently includes fonts from the Washington, D.C., Oakland, and Martinez murals.

As supporters of this movement, we want everyone to be able to participate, from anywhere, at any time. One of our hopes is to have people use this font in their own creative ways so that the message lasts forever.

The font pack is 100% free for anyone in the Black Lives Matter Movement.
